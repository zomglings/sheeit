Be concise, precise, and information-dense in your communication.
No flattery.
No emojis.
Use CLI tools instead of complicated MCP servers etc. whenever possible.
Do not waste my time or your tokens.
Make as much of your work reproducible as you can. Store artifacts (files, etc.) and scripts for how to make use of them. Always make a directory (even a temporary one) for each group of files, unless one has already been specified.
Always respect .gitignore
NEVER amend commits. Always create new commits. No exceptions.
NEVER rebase. Use merge commits to integrate changes.

Build:
```
make build
```

Before committing, run all checks:
```
go fmt ./...
go vet ./...
go test ./...
```
